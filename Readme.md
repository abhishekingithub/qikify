# Qikify
      
  Qikify is an MVC framework for adaptive test and semiconductor data analysis
  built on [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/) and
  [numpy](http://numpy.scipy.org/).
  
  The objective of this project is to simplify the task of working with 
  semiconductor data in production environments.
  
## Known issues

  This software is in early pre-alpha state. There are several rounds of refactoring remaining before it approaches production quality.


## Installation

  This project is built on and requires the following software:  
  
  * python 2.7.2+
  * numpy 1.6.1+
  * scipy 0.9.0+
  * sklearn 0.10+
  * pandas 0.7.3+

  Once the above are installed, install qikify with:

    git clone git://github.com/natekupp/qikify.git
	  cd qikify
	  python setup.py install

  to get started with the code.

## Features

  * Intuitive data model
  * Modular support for "controllers" to implement machine-learning analysis techniques
  * Web-based interaction with machine-learning tasks running server-side.

## Example
TODO: Need example demonstrating usage.
