# Qikify
      
  Qikify is an MVC framework for adaptive test and semiconductor data analysis
  built on [scikits.learn](http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/), and
  [numpy](http://numpy.scipy.org/) using Python.

## Known issues

  This software is in early pre-alpha state. There are several rounds of refactoring remaining before it approaches production quality.


## Installation

  This project is built on and requires the following software:  
  
  * python 2.7.2
  * numpy 1.6.1rc1
  * scipy 0.9.0
  * sklearn 0.9
  * pandas 0.5.1.dev-75026f2

  Once the above are installed, install qikify with:

     git clone git://github.com/natekupp/qikify.git
	 cd qikify
	 python setup.py install

  to get started.

## Features

  * Intuitive data model
  * Modular support for "controllers" to implement machine-learning analysis techniques
  * Web-based interaction with machine-learning tasks running server-side via [node.js](http://nodejs.org)

## Example
TODO: Need example demonstrating usage.
